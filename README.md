# Titanic, Yelp, and Job Description Data Science Case Study

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive data science case study that explores three different datasets:

1. **Titanic Dataset**: Survival analysis and feature exploration.
2. **Yelp Reviews Dataset**: Text analysis and user interaction insights.
3. **Job Descriptions Dataset**: Text mining and classification of job titles based on descriptions.

The project demonstrates data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling using Python and popular libraries such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

## Project Structure
- `taitanic+yelp+case_study.ipynb`: Main notebook containing all analysis and code.
- `titanic.csv`: Titanic passenger data.
- `yelp.csv`: Yelp reviews data.
- `job_title_des.csv`: Job descriptions and titles data.

## Key Steps
### 1. Titanic Dataset
- Data exploration and cleaning (handling missing values, outliers)
- Visualization of survival rates by gender, age, and embarkation point
- Feature engineering (one-hot encoding)

### 2. Yelp Dataset
- Exploration of review ratings and user interactions
- Visualization of rating distributions and user activity
- Word cloud generation for review text

### 3. Job Descriptions Dataset
- Text cleaning and word frequency analysis
- Visualization of most common skills and job title distributions
- Machine learning model (Naive Bayes) to classify job titles from descriptions
- Evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn wordcloud
   ```
3. Open the notebook `taitanic+yelp+case_study.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and results.
